There are two basic kinds of systems: Photovoltaic or PV uses sunlight to generate electricity. It\u2019s the same technology found on pocket calculators, just on a larger scale.

Solar panels work even when it\u2019s raining or cloudy. For instance, Germany isn\u2019t known for being a warm and sunny place but its solar power plants produce between 20-30% of all its energy daily. New Jersey and Massachusetts aren\u2019t nearly as sunny as California or Arizona yet New Jersey now ranks 3rd in the country for solar capacity and Massachusetts ranks 4th. In fact, solar panels can work even in cold and snowy weather.

When the sun sets, solar panels go into a dormant state because they cannot produce electricity from darkness. They need the photons provided by sunlight to stimulate the flow of electrons in their semiconductor materials, thereby producing a current. However, this doesn\u2019t mean solar energy can\u2019t be used at night.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Energy produced during the day can be stored in a battery for use when the sun is not shining, including at nighttime. Moreover, depending on the grid system, surplus energy produced during the day can be fed back into the grid and then drawn back during the night, effectively using the grid as a storage system.<\/p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t<div data-component=\"wmx:accordion-panel\" class=\" block--accordion-panel accordion-item\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"accordion-header\">\n\t\t\t\t<button class=\"accordion-button collapsed\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 class=\"mb-0\">How long will my solar energy system last?<\/h5>\n\t\t\t\t<\/button>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"\" data-bs-parent=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n<p>If properly installed, it should last&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.solarenergyworld.com\/install-process\/products\/\">30-40 years<\/a>.

Because the devices and systems that use energy in your home do not run constantly, kWh is used to measure just how much energy you&#8217;re actually using. For example, if you use a 100W lightbulb for 10 hours each day, you are using the equivalent of 1kWh (100W x 10 hours = 1000Wh = 1kWh) that day. If you maintain that use every day, that will equal 30kWh in a month for your lightbulb usage. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Your utility company most likely bills you on your home&#8217;s kWh usage each month. Nationwide, the average kWh usage a month is about 900, though that number can vary greatly per household depending on house size, amount of electronics, climate (more AC\/heating), as well as many other factors. <\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Solar works by producing kilowattage with your panels, allowing you to use that energy and not have to pay the utility company for that energy usage. Because utility companies are constantly increasing the rates they charge per kWh used, solar helps avoid these rate increases by letting you produce energy yourself, rather than needing to buy it from the utility.<\/p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t<div data-component=\"wmx:accordion-panel\" class=\" block--accordion-panel accordion-item\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"accordion-header\">\n\t\t\t\t<button class=\"accordion-button collapsed\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 class=\"mb-0\">How much does solar cost?<\/h5>\n\t\t\t\t<\/button>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"\" data-bs-parent=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n<p>Other than our $0-down options (explained below), providing an exact price on our website is not possible because every homeowner\u2019s situation is different.

Homeowners typically pay 20-30% less for electricity costs once their system is installed. Some call our PPA the \u201cno-brainer\u201d option because homeowners literally pay nothing to start saving on their utility bills.<\/li>\n\n\n\n<li>Ownership: We offer a financing option where you can purchase a solar system for $0 down. Plus the cost for equipment has gone down dramatically in recent years, and there are also many tax breaks, electricity buy-back programs, and incentives available to those who wish to own their solar system that could end up reducing purchase price by 30%. With all of our purchase options your monthly loan payment COMBINED with your new post-solar utility bill can be lower than what you paid to your utility alone prior to going solar. When you own your solar system you can also earn revenue from the electricity your system produces through net metering and SRECs which is why ROI from purchase is so high.<\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n\n\n<p>To learn more about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https:\/\/www.solarenergyworld.com\/pricing\/0-down-vs-purchase\/\">financing options<\/a>&nbsp;available for homeowners who want to install solar panels, check out our blog post on \u2018<a href=\"https:\/\/www.solarenergyworld.com\/how-to-get-solar-panels-for-your-home\/\">How to Get Solar Panels for Your Home<\/a>\u2018.<\/p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n\n\n\t\t<div data-component=\"wmx:accordion-panel\" class=\" block--accordion-panel accordion-item\">\n\t\t\t\n\t\t\t<div class=\"accordion-header\">\n\t\t\t\t<button class=\"accordion-button collapsed\" data-bs-toggle=\"collapse\" data-bs-target=\"\" aria-expanded=\"false\" aria-controls=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\t<h5 class=\"mb-0\">Is a PPA (Power Purchase Agreement) or Lease transferable?<\/h5>\n\t\t\t\t<\/button>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<div class=\"accordion-collapse collapse\" aria-labelledby=\"\" data-bs-parent=\"\">\n\t\t\t\t<div class=\"accordion-body\">\n\t\t\t\t\t\n\n<p>If you sell your house, you may transfer the PPA or Lease to the new homeowner or purchase the system.

These supplies are vulnerable to political upheaval, trade disputes, embargoes, and other disruptions. In 1973 we imported only about 34% of our oil, and yet the 1973 oil embargo was a serious blow to the economy. Today we import over 53%, and are more vulnerable every year. Solar energy can help reduce this dependency, making our economy, our nation, and your family more secure.<\/p>\n\n\t\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t\t<\/div>\n\t\t<\/div>\n\n\t\n\t\t\n                <\/div>\n        <\/div>\n<\/div>\n\n\n    <\/div>\n\n                            <\/div>\n                    <\/div>\n                <\/div>\n            <\/section>\n        \n\n            <section id=\"wmx-section-wrapper-dbv4ytu\" data-component=\"wmx:section-wrapper\" class=\" block block--section-wrapper \" style=\"padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--50);\" data-wmx-wpb=\"section-wrapper\" >\n                <div class=\"container\">\n                    <div class=\"row\">\n                        <div class=\"col-12\">\n                                                        \n    <div class=\"inner-wrapper\">\n\n        \n\n<h2 data-component=\"core:heading\" class=\" wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-our-recent-blogs\">Our Recent Blogs<\/h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Stay up-to-date with the latest news and insights on solar energy by checking out our Solar Energy World blog.
