Privacy<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Solar Energy World, LLC (\u201cSEW\u201d) operates www.solarenergyworld.com. It is SEW\u2019s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information we may collect while operating our website. Any information you provide to us by filling out a form on our website will not be sold to or shared with outside parties who could use that information to solicit or sell their products or services to you. When you fill out a form on our website, you are only authorizing Solar Energy World, LLC (\u201cSEW\u201d) to contact you by phone and\/or send text messages, and\/or emails about SEW products and services at the email and\/or telephone number you entered even if you are on a national or state \u201cDo Not Call\u201d list.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you also provide your street address to us, SEW may mail you any of the following: free gifts and promotional items, invitations to our events, special offers or announcements. &nbsp;Your address could also be used by SEW employees to view your home or business online to determine if your building is eligible for our products and services and\/or to provide service to you if you are a current customer. You can opt out anytime.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-component=\"core:heading\" class=\" wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-2-website-visitors\">2. Website Visitors<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Like most website operators, SEW collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. SEW\u2019s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how SEW\u2019s visitors use its website. From time to time, SEW may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of its website.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEW also collects potentially personally-identifying information including, but not limited to, Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users, account holders, and for users leaving comments on www.solarenergyworld.com blogs\/sites. SEW may disclose logged in user and commenter IP addresses under the same circumstances that it uses and discloses personally-identifying information as described below, except that commenter IP addresses and email addresses are visible and disclosed to the administrators of the blog\/site where the comment was left.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-component=\"core:heading\" class=\" wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-3-gathering-of-personally-identifying-information\">3. Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Certain visitors to SEW\u2019s websites choose to interact with SEW in ways that require SEW to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that SEW gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. For example, we ask visitors who sign up or submit information requests at www.solarenergyworld.com to provide a name, email address, and other information necessary to communicate with the person.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-component=\"core:heading\" class=\" wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-4-aggregated-statistics\">4. Aggregated Statistics<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SEW may collect statistics about the behavior of visitors to its website. SEW may display this information publicly or provide it to others. However, SEW does not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-component=\"core:heading\" class=\" wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-5-use-of-information\">5. Use of Information<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>SEW may use the information we collect from and about you from our website for any of the following purposes: (1) To present our services and their contents to you; (2) To analyze, systems, and to develop new products and services; (3) To provide you with information, products, or services that you request from us, and to contact and communicate with you when necessary; (4) To assess the suitability of your home for a solar system; (5) To notify you about changes to our services or any products or services we offer or provide though them; (6) To provide you and other users with customized content, targeted offers, and advertising on the services, or across other websites, mobile applications, social media or online services, or via direct mail, email, and\/or telemarketing regarding offers, contests, events, news, programs, and other retail opportunities from us and\/or selected third parties that we believe may be of interest to you; (7) To determine the effectiveness of our marketing programs; (8) To use your data in an aggregated non-specific format for analytical and demographic purposes; or (9) In any other way we may describe when you provide the information to us.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>SEW may use third parties to measure and target advertisements for us about our products and services that are tailored to your online interests. We allow these third-party companies to use cookies, web beacons, pixel tags and similar technologies to collect certain data and other information about your online activity. This information is used to display advertisements for SEW on the services or across other websites, mobile applications, social media or online services that you use.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>We also may display interest-based ads through Facebook, Twitter, or other social media platforms or websites. This is done through the Facebook Custom Audiences, Twitter Tailor Audiences, or other similar business tools. These tools allow us to personalize our ads based on your shopping experience with us, without having to share your personal information with these social media platforms. We do this only by sharing hashed information (which converts your email or phone number to a unique string of numbers and letters) that the social media platform then matches data against its own data for the limited purpose of serving advertisements (either directly to you or to other lookalike audiences). The matched and unmatched hashes are then deleted, and are not used for any other purpose.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-component=\"core:heading\" class=\" wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-6-disclosure-restrictions\">6. Disclosure Restrictions<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>\u00a0Marketing and Disclosure Restrictions: Mobile information will not be shared with third parties\/affiliates for marketing\/promotional purposes.

Consent to contact doesn\u2019t require you to purchase any service. By making any online quote or other information request through this website, you further agree to Solar Energy World, LLC\u2019s website Terms of Use and&nbsp;Solar Energy World, LLC\u2019s Privacy Policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-component=\"core:heading\" class=\" wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-8-personally-identifying-information\">8.

Cookies (Session Identifiers)<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A cookie is a string of information that a website stores on a visitor\u2019s computer, and that the visitor\u2019s browser provides to the website each time the visitor returns. SEW uses cookies to help SEW identify and track visitors, their usage of SEW website, and their website access preferences.

Business Transfers<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>If SEW, or substantially all of its assets, are acquired, or in the unlikely event that SEW goes out of business or enters bankruptcy, user information would be one of the assets that is transferred or acquired by a third party. You acknowledge that such transfers may occur, and that any acquirer of SEW may continue to use your personal information as set forth in this policy.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-component=\"core:heading\" class=\" wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-11-advertisements\">11. Advertisements<\/h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Advertisements appearing online may be delivered to users by advertising partners, who may set cookies. These cookies allow the ad server to recognize your computer each time they send you an online advertisement to compile information about you or others who use your computer. This information allows ad networks to, among other things, deliver targeted advertisements that they believe will be of most interest to you. This Privacy Policy covers the use of cookies by SEW and does not cover the use of cookies by any advertisers.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<h3 data-component=\"core:heading\" class=\" wp-block-heading\" id=\"h-12-privacy-policy-changes\">12.
